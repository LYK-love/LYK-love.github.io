# Def

Survey是对一大批样本进行研究，以理解样本的某些特征或行为

* 和Case Study的区别： Case Study研究某个具体的对象，而Survey对一大批样本进行研究



Survey研究示例表格：

| characteristic          |                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| type of objectives      | To identify how KMS helps in developing and maintaining trust in GSD team members. |
| type of survey design   | Cross-section. 182 responses were received from all over the world in three weeks. |
| survey administration   | Web-based. a questionnaire was developed and administered on the web. |
| developing instrument   | A questionnaire was prepared based on tested questions used in the literature in order to enhance the validity of the questions. Where validated items were unavailable, new questions were developed based on literature study. <br />Responses of each questionnaire item was given on a 5-point scaling ranging from 5= “strongly agree” to 1= “strongly disagree”. The questionnaire was divided into two parts; part one was related to the personal information of the respondent and the second part consist of actual 35-items questions. (close question, ordinal scales) |
| population              | The population consists of those people who are working in GSD organizations, posses some experience of using KMS and are using KMS in their organizations. |
| sampling method         | Not mentioned. The survey link was sent through the email to invite the GSD organizations employees who are using KMS in their organizations. The sampling method of this study is not mentioned in the article, and we speculate that the sampling method of this study may be **non-probabilistic sampling.** |
| sample size             | Not mentioned. A total of 182 responses were received from all over the world. After analysis 6 questionnaires were discarded as they were incomplete, hence total 176 questionnaires were considered for analysis. |
| response rate           | Not mentioned. Across the study, we can only know that the respondents number is 182. But we don't know how many employees received the email with link of questionaire. |
| evaluate the instrument | Not mentioned.                                               |
| data analysis           | quantitative analysis                                        |



# Types

* Questionnaire-based survey
  * longitudinal survey
  * cross-sectional survey

* Interview
  * structured interview
  * semi-structured interview – open-ended interview?

* Literature survey
  * ad hoc literature review专门的文献检查
  * systematic (literature) review – mapping study
  * meta-analysis

# Steps

1. Setting objectives

2. Survey design
3. Developing instrument (questionnaire)
4. Evaluating instrument
5. Obtaining data
6. Analysing data
7. Reporting survey

## 1.Setting objectives

- to evaluate the rate or frequency of some characteristic that occurs in a population
- to assess the severity of some characteristic or condition that occurs in a population
- to identify factors that influence a characteristic or condition

## 2.Survey design

* 横断面式Cross-sectional: 参与者被要求提供一个固定的时间点上的信息

* 纵向式Longitudinal: 参与者提供关于特定人群随时间变化的信息，以确定影响某一特征或条件的因素

* Other forms of survey design
  * e.g., compare different populations



* Self-administrated questionnaires：自编问卷
  * web-based (Internet)
  * email or newsletter

* Telephone surveys

* Interviews
  * one-to-one interviews
  * one-to-multiple interviews

## 3.Developing instrument (questionnaire)

### Construct an Instrument

* Open *or* closed questions
* Designing questions
  * appropriate language and fully defined terms 
  * standard grammar, punctuation and spelling
  * single concept per question
  * no vague or ambiguous qualifiers
  * negative or positive questions but double negative
  * no sensitive or privacy questions

### answer types

* numeric values
* response categories
  * exhaustive but not too long
  * mutually exclusive
  * multiple selections?
  * an “other” category?

* yes/no answers
* 顺序量表
* 文字回答

## motivation

What is the purpose of the study?


## 4.Evaluating instrument

* Reliability
* Validity

## 5.Obtaining Data

* Probabilistic sampling
* Cluster-base sampling： surveying individuals that belong to defined groups
* Non-probabilistic sampling： 不随机



## 6.Analyzing Data

*“If you are not sure or don*’*t know an answer just leave the line blank; otherwise it is important to answer YES or NO to the first section of every Technique/Technology section.”*
