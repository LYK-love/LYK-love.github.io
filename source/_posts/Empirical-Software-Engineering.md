# Philosophical Stances



* Positivism(实证主义):
  * all knowledge must be based on logical inference from a set ofbasic observable facts



* Constructivism(建构主义):
  * scientific knowledge CANNOT be separated from its human/social context



* Transformative/Participatory(改造/参与性):
  * research needs to be related with a political agenda 研究需要与政治议程有关



* Pragmatism(实用主义):
  * all knowledge is approximate and incomplete and its value depends on the methods by which it was obtained



**不同哲学立场对应不同的实证研究方法：**

* Positivism: Experiments, Survey,Confirmatory case studies
* Constructivism: Ethnographies, Exploratory case studies
* Advocacy/Participatory: Action research, Interview
* Pragmatism: Mixed methods: Experiments, Case studies, Survey, Action research

# Empirical methods

| **Empirical Method** | **Precondition**| **Sampling**| **Challenges**|
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Experiments**      | A clear hypothesis that guides the entire experimental design | Random                                        | Control of variables except the chosen independent ones      |
| **Case Studies**     | A clear RQ concerned with how or why certain phenomena occur | 有目的取样                                | Data collection & analysis is more open to interpretation and researcher bias |
| **Survey Research** | A clear RQ that asks about the nature of a particular target population | 从目标群体中选择 | Control for sampling bias<br>Low response rates<br>Question design to yield valid data |
| **Ethnographies**    | A clear RQ that focuses on the cultural practices of a community w/o any pre-existing theories | Chain or representative                       | Detailed observation , data collection & analysis while avoiding preconceptions |
| **Action Research**  | A problem owner willing to collaborate to both identify a problem and engage in an effort to solve it | n/a                                           | Immaturity as an empirical method                            |

# Research Measurements

不同的实证研究方法，如experiment, case study, survey, 都有自己的度量，这里列出最general的度量

## Formalism

* Immersion approaches
  * rely more on researchers’ interpretive skills • 

* Editing approaches
  * includefewaprioricodesbasedonfindingsofthe researcher during the analysis
* Template approaches
  * more formal with more a priori based on research questions

* Quasi-statistical approaches
  * much formalized, e.g., word frequency analysis

## Validity



* Construct Validity: 
  * to what extent the measures really represent what is investigated by the research questions

* Criterion validity:
  * how well the responses for the particular tests match others used in the field, or responses for different tests that should be correlated
* Predictive validity
  * if a response can be shown to be accurately predictive of the intended phenomenon

* Content validity
  * establishing acceptance that a construct measures what it claims to
* Face validity
  * a cursory review of items by untrained judges

* Internal Validity
  * whether one factor affects an investigated factor

* External validity
  * to what extent it is able to generalize the findings

## Reliability

to what extent the data and the analysis are dependent on the specific researchers



* Test-retest (intra-observer)
  * if the same person responds to a survey twice, how likely to get the same answers each time?

* Alternate form reliability
  * rewording or re-ordering questions in different versions of the questionnaire

* Inter-observer (inter-rater)
  * the reliability of surveys that involve a (group) of trained person completing a survey instrument based on their own observations
