# Decision Problem

* **Statement of a decision problem**
  * Part 1: instance description defining the input
  * Part2: question stating the actual yes-or-no question
* **A decision problem is a mapping from all possible inputs into the set {yes, no}**

## Optimization vs. Decision

* Usually, an optimization problem can be rephrased as a decision problem.
  * 优化问题往往比判定问题难
* If the decision problem can't be solved in **polynomial time**, then the corresponding optimization problem can't be either.
* Often, it can be proved that the decision can be solved in **polynomial time ** <u>if and only if</u> the corresponding optimization problem can. （ 通常， 判定问题在多项式时间可解当且仅当优化问题在多项式时间可解）

## Some Typical Decision Problems

* **Graph coloring**
  * Given a undirected graph G and a positive integer *k*, is there a coloring of G using at most *k* colors?
* **Job scheduling with penalties**
  * Given a group of jobs, each with its execution duration, deadline and penalty for missing the deadline, and a nonnegative integer *k*, is there a schedule with the total penalty bounded by *k*?
* **Bin packing**
  * Given *k* bins each of capacities one, and *n* objects with size $s_1,\dots,s_n$, (where $s_{i}$ is a rational number in (0,1] ). Do the *n* objects fit in *k* bins?
* **Knapsack**
  * Given a knapsack of capacity C, *n* objects with sizes $s_1, \dots, s_n$ and "profits" $p_1, \dots, p_n$, and a positive integer *k*. Is there a subset of the *n* objects that fits in the knapsack and has total profit at least *k*?
    * ( **Subset sum**  as a simplified version )
* **CNF-Satisfiability**
  * Given a CNF formula, is there a truth assignment that satisfied it?
* **Hamiltonian cycles or Hamiltonian paths**
* **Traveling salespersion**
  * 带权完全图，问是否存在总权小于 *k* 的哈密尔顿回路？

## Theory of NP-Completeness

* What it **cannot** do
  * Provide a method of obtaining polynomial time algorithms for those "hard" problems.  不能为难问题提出高效解
  * Negate  the existence of algorithms of polynomial complexity for those problems. 不能否定难问题的高效解的存在
* What it **can** do
  * Show that many of the problems for which there is no known polynomial time algorithm are computationally related.  可以给问题难度分档

# The class P

* **A <u>polynomially</u> bounded <u>algorithm</u>**
  * is one with its **worse-case** complexity bounded by a polynomial function of the input size
* **A <u>polynomially</u> bounded <u>problem</u>**
  * is one for which there is a polynomially bounded algorithm.
    * "bounded"： 问题只要小于等于多项式时间。 如O(logn)不是多项式，但是小于多项式，这也算多项式可解
* **The <u>class P</u> is the class of decision problems that are polynomially bounded**

## Notes one the class P

* **Class P has a too broad coverage**
* **However**
  * The problem not in P must be extremely expensive and probably impossible to solve in practice.
  * The problems in P have nice "closure" properties for algorithm integration.
  * The property of being in P is **independent of the particular formal model of computation used**.

# **The class NP**

* **A polynomial bounded  nondeterministic algorithm**( 非确定性算法, 就是猜一个解并验证这个解 )
  * $O(p(n))$ time for some polynomial function $p(n)$
  * **For all** possible executions
* **The class NP**
  * is the class of decision problems for which there is a polynomial bounded nondeterministic algorithm.

* **NP means Non-deterministic P**
  * From "deterministic" to "non-deterministic"
  * From "solve a problem" to “verify the answer of a problem"
* **What does NP indicate?**
  * Harder problems
  * **Not too hard**
    * At least, you can quickly understand the answer

## Proof of Being in NP

先猜一个解； 对于任意一个猜的解，你都能够验证yes or no, 如果这两个步骤都必定能够在多项式时间内结束，则该问题为NP( NP不是Not P ! )

* **Graph coloring is in NP**

  * Phase1 - Guess a certificate
    * Description of the input and the certificate
  * Guess2 - Verify the certificate
    * There are *n* colors listed: $c_1,c_2,\dots,c_n$ ( not necessarily different )
    * Each $c_i$ is in the range $1,\dots,k$​  //颜色在范围内
    * Scan the list of edges to see if a conflict exists //颜色有无冲突
  * Phase1 and 2 in polynomial time

* **CLIQUE is in NP**

  ```c++
  void nodeteClique( graph G, int n, int k )
  {
  	S = genCertif(); // in O(n)
      if( S is a clique of size k )	Output "accept";
      else Output "reject"; // in O(k^2)
      return
  
  }
  ```

  

* **SAT**

  略

## Relation between  P and NP

* An deterministic algorithm for a decision problem is a special  case of a nondeterministic algorithm, which means: $P \subset NP$​（已证明）

* Intuition implies that **NP** is much larger than **P**. 直觉和经验告诉我们P**真包含**于NP， 但目前没人能证明
  * The number of possible *s* is exponential in *n*.
  * No one problem in **NP** has been proved not in **P**.

# Reduction between problems

* 归约： reduce P to Q. 通过解决Q来间接解决P

  * 把P的输入转换为Q的合法输入
  * 并验证正确性（符合Specification）

* "P多项式时间归约到Q"  记为 $P \leq_P Q$​​. 

  * 如果解决了Q，根据归约，能够解决P
  * 如果解决了P，还不能根据归约解决Q
  * 这说明**Q更难**
  * 若Q问题多项式时间可解，可证明P问题也是多项式时间可解。 证明略
  *  $\leq_P$ 是可传递的。（通过多项式的封闭性可证）

  

# NP-Complete Problems

## Definition

* A  problem Q is **NP-hard** if **every** problem P in **NP** is reducible to Q, that is $P \leq_P Q$​.

  （which means that Q is at least as hard as any problem in **NP** ）

  * 比所有NP都难或者一样难，但是难度上不封顶，甚至可以不属于NP（ 比如不可判定问题 ）

* A problem Q is **NP-complete** if it is **in NP** and is **NP-hard**( which means that Q is at most as hard as to be solved by a polynomially bounded nondeterministic algorithm  )

 

### P and NP - Revisited

* Intuition implies that **NP** is a much larger set than **P**
	* No one problem in **NP** has been proved not in **P**.
* If any **NP - completed** problem is in **P**, then **NP = P **
	* Which means that every problems in **NP** can be reducible to a problem in **P**

  

## Proof of NP-Completeness

* Knowledge ： P is  NPC
* Task: to prove that Q is NPC
* Approach: to reduce P to Q
  * 已知 For any $R \in NP$, $ R \le_P P$​ ​
  * Show $P \le_P Q$
  * Then $R \le_P Q$, by transitivity of reductions
  * Done. Q is NP-complete ( given that Q has been proven in NP ) 即通过传递性证明Q是NP-hard, 而Q是否为NP需要另外证明
* 该证明需要知道一个**最初的NPC**
  * SAT问题, 由*Cook*提出

### Satisfiability Problem

* **CNF**
* **CNF-SAT problem**
* **a special case: 3-SAT**
  * 子句中的布尔量永远小于等于3 (  永远小于等于二 则成为2-SAT)

### Example: Prove CLIQUE is NPC

* 把3-SAT的输入转换成图作为CLIQUE 的输入,并证明3-SAT的输出(即只能个语句是否为True)等价于CLIQUE的输出
