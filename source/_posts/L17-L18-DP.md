# Basic Idea of DP

* Smart recursion
  * Compute each subproblem **only once**
* Basic process of a "smart" recursion
  * Find a reverse topological order for the subproblem graph
    * In most cases, the order can be determined **by partial knowledge** of the problem.
    * General method based on DFS is available.
  * Scheduling the subproblems according to the reverse topological order
  * Record the subproblem solutions in a dictionary.

# Minimum Cost Matrix Multiplication

## BF1

* 总是在某个位置开始第一次乘法

```C++
mmTry1(dim,len,seq)
    if(len < 3) bestCost = 0;
	else
        bestCost = ∞;
		for(i=1; i < len ; i++ )
            c=cost of muliplication at position seq[i];
			newSeq = seq with ith element deleted;
			b= mmTry1(dim, len-1, newSeq);
			bestCost=min(bestCost, b+c);
	return bestCost;
```

* $T(n)= (n-1)T(n-1)+n$
* $\Theta( (n-1)! )$

## BF2

* 必然在某个位置k相乘
* BF1“总是在某个位置开始第一次乘法”，子问题规模下降过慢

```python
mmTry2(dim, low,high)
	if(high - low == 1 ) bestCost=0; //only one matrix
	else
		bestCost = ∞
		for( k = low + 1; k < high; k++ )
			a = mmyTry2(dim, low,k);
			b = mmyTry2(dim, k, high);
            c = cost of multiplication at position k;
            bestCost = min(bestCost,a+b+c);
    return bestCost;
```

* $W(n)=2W(n-1)+n$
* $O(2^n)$

## A DP solution

```
matrixOrder(n,cost,last) //last记的是位置
	for( low=n-1; low > 1; low-- )//按行，从下往上填
		for(high-low+1; high <= n; high++ )//按列，从左往右填
			Compute solution of subproblem ( low,high  ) and store it in cost[low][high] 				and last[low][high]
			
	return cost[0][n]
			
		
```

* 时间 $\Theta(n^3)$​
* 空间 $\Theta(n^2)$

# Weighted Binary Search Tree

* 规定$A(T) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n {p_ic_i}$​,  其中$c_i = depth(i) + 1$​， $p_i$​是节点i被访问到的概率。 如何优化WBST使得A(T)最小？

## Problem Rephrased

* Subproblem identification
  * The keys are in sorted order
  * Each subproblem can be identified as a pair of index (low,high)
* Expected solution of the subproblem
  * For each key $K_i$, a weight $p_i$ is associated.
    * $p_i$​ is the possibility that the key is searched for
  * The subproblem (low,high) is to find the binary search tree with **minimum weighted retrieval cost** 

##  minimum weighted retrieval cost

* **A(low,high,r)**  is the minimum weighted retrieval cost for subproblem (low,high) where $K_r$​ is chosen as the root of its BST​
* **A(low,high)**  is the minimum weighted retrieval cost for subproblem (low,high) over all choices of the root key
* **p(low,high)**, equal to $p_{low} + p_{low+1} + \dots + p_{high}$ is the weight of the subproblem (low,high)
  * p(low,high) is the possibility that the key searched for is in this interval.

## Subproblem solutions

* **Weighted retrieval cost of a subtree**

  * *T* contains $K_{low}, \dots, K_{high}$​​, and the weighted retrieval cost of R is W, with *T* **being a whole tree**.

  * As a subtree with the root at level 1, the weighted retrieval cost of *T* will be :  $W + p(low,high)$​

    * $p(low,high)$​是子问题并入大问题时所付出的代价（修正量）,即 “whole tree”变成子树所付出的修正量

    * $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(p_i . (c_i + 1)) =  \sum\limits_{i=1}^n {p_ic_i} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}p_i = W + p(low,high)$​

  * 根$K_r$​的代价是$p_{r}$​

* So， the recursive relations are:

  $A(low,high,r) \\ = p_r + p(low,r-1) + A(low,r-1) +  p(r+1, high) + A(r+1, high)\\ = p(low,high) + A(low,r-1)+A(r+1,high)$

  * $A(low,high) = min{ A(low,high,r) | \quad low \leq r \leq high}$

```c++
optimalBST( prob,n,cost,root )
	for(low=n+1; low >= 1; low-- )
		for(high=low-1; high <= n; high++)
			bestChoice(prob,cost,root,low,high);
	return cost;
```

```C++
bestChoice(prob,cost,root,low,high)
	if(high < low )
		bestCost=0;
		bestRoot=-1;
	else
		bestCost = ∞;
	for( r = low; r <= high ; r++ )
		rCost = p(low,high) + cost[low][r-1]+cost[r+1][high];
		if(rCost < bestCost)
			bestCost = rCost;
			bestRoot=r;
		cost[low][high]=bestCost;
		root[low][high]=bestRoot;
    return
```

* $\Theta(n^3)$

# From the DP perspective

## All-pairs shortest paths SSSP over DAG

 $D.dis = min\{ B.dis + 1, C.dis+3 \}$

## Edit distance

* You can edit a word by
  * **I**nsert, **D**elete, **R**eplace
* Edit distance
  * Minimum number of edit operations
* Problem
  * Given two strings, compute the edit distance

```c++
EditDistance( A[1...m], B[1...m] ):
	for j=1 to n:
		Edit[0,j] =j;
	for i=1 to m:
		Edit[i,0] = i;
		for j=1 to n:
			if A[i] = B[j]
				Edit[i,j] = min { Edit[i-1,j],Edit[i,j-1]+1,Edit{i-1,j-1} }
			else
				Edit[i,j] = min { Edit[i-1,j],Edit[i,j-1]+1,Edit{i-1,j-1} + 1 }
	return Edit[m,n]
```



## Highway restaurants

* **Highway restaurants**
  * n possible locations on a straight line
    * $m_1,m_2,m_3,\dots,m_n$
  * At most one restaurant at one location
    * Expected profit for location *i* is $p_{i}$
  * Any two restaurants should be at least *k* miles apart
* **How to arrange the restaurants**
  * To obtain the maximum expected profit



* The recursion
  * P(j): the max profit achievable using only first j locations 只开若干个餐厅,其中最大序号为j, 所获得的利润
    * P(0) = 0
  * prev[j]: largest index before j and k miles away

$$
P(j) = max( p_j + P(prev[j]),P(j-1) )
$$

* One dimension DP algorithm
  * Fill in P[0],P[1], ... , P[n]

```
(First compute the prev[.] array)  //预处理
i = 0
for j = 1 to n:
	while m_{i+1} <= m_{j} - l: // m[i]是第i个餐厅的位置
		i = i+1;
	prev[j] = i; // 预处理结束
	
(Now the DP begins)
P[0]=0;
for j = 1 to n:
	P[j] = max( p_j + P[prev[j]], P[j-1] );
return P[n];

```



## Separating Sequence of words

* Words into lines:
  * Word-length $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ and line-width: **W**
* Basic constraint
  * If $w_i, w_{i+1}, \dots, w_j$ are in one line, then $w_i, w_{i+1}, \dots, w_j \leq W$ 

* Penalty for one line: some function of X, X is:
  * 0 for the last line in a paragraph, and
  * $W-(w_i, w_{i+1}, \dots, w_j)$ for other lines
* The problem
  * How to make the penalty of the paragraph, which is the sum of the penalties of individual lines, minimized







```python
LineBreakDP

for i = n; i >= 1; i--:
	if all words through w_i to w_n can be put into one line then:
		Penalty[i] = 0;
		<put all words through i yo n in one line>
	else 
		for i=1; w_i + ... + w_{i+k-1} <= W; k++:
			calculate the penalty Cost_{cur} of putting words in this line;
			minCost = min{minCost,Cost_{cur} + Penalty[ i+k ]};
			<Updating k_{min}, which records the k part that produced the minimun penalty>;
			<Put words i through i + k_{min}> - 1 on one line;
	Penalty = minCost;
```

### Analysis of LineBreakDP

* Each subproblem is identified by only one integer *k*, for (*k*,*n*)
  * Number of vertex in the subproblem graph: at most *n*
  * So, in **DP** version, the recursion is executed at most *n* times.
* So, the running time is in $\Theta(Wn)$
  * The loop is executed at most **W/2** times. //每个单词后都有空格,标点
  * In fact, W, the line width, is usually a constant. So, $\Theta(n)$
  * The extra space for the dictionary is $\Theta(n)$

## Changing coins  

* How to pay a given amount of money?

*  贪心不行

### Subproblems

* **Assumptions**
  * Given *n* different denotations
  * A coin of denomination *i* has $d_{i}$​ units  面额为*i*的硬币代表了$d_{i}$的金钱
  * The amount to be paid: *N*
* Subproblems [i,j]
  * The minimum number of coins required to pay an amount  of *j* units, using only coins of denominations 1 to *i*.
* The problem
  * Figure out subproblems [ n, N ] ( as c[n, N] )

*  易得:

  * c[i,0] is 0 for all *i*
  * $c[i,j]=min\{c[i-1,j], 1+ c[1+c[i,j-d_i]\}$ 

  

```c++
int coinChange( int N, int n, int[] coin)
    int denomination[] = [d_1, d_2, ..., d_n];
	for(i=1; i<=n; i++)
        coin[i,0]=0;
	for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
        for(j=1;j<=N;j++)
            if( i == 1 && j <denomination[i] ) coin[i,j] = + ∞; //只有一个硬币且面额大于所需金额,不满足
			else if( i == 1 ) coin[i,j] = 1 + coin[1, j - denomination[1]];//只有一个硬币,其面额小于等于所需金额
			else if(j < denomination[i]) coin[i,j] = coin[i-1,j];//不止一个硬币,最后一枚的面额大于所需金额, 则剔除这枚硬币
			else coin[i,j] = min( coin[i-1,j], 1 + coin[j-denomination[i]] );
	return coin[n,N];
```

# Elemens of DP

## Principle of Optimality

* 重叠子问题
* 蛮力找最优
* Optimal substructure: 大问题的最优解必然由小问题的最优解组合而成.
  * Given an optimal sequence of decisions, each **subsequence** must be **optimal** by itself
  * Positive example: shortest path
  * Counter example: longest (simple) path
  * **DP relies on the principle of optimality**
