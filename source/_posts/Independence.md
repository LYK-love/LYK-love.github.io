# Independence of Events

Let $A_1,\cdots, A_n$ be $n$ arbitrary statements about [random variables](https://statproofbook.github.io/D/rvar) $X_1,X_2, \cdots,X_n$ with possible values $\mathcal{X}_1,\mathcal{X}_2, \cdots,\mathcal{X}_n$ ,

$A_1,\cdots, A_n$  is called statistically independent, if $\text{for all} \; x_i \in \mathcal{X}_i, \; i = 1, \ldots, n$:
$$
p(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(X_i = x_i)
$$

Note:
$$
p(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i) = p(A_1,\cdots, A_n) = p(X_1 = x_1, \cdots, X_n = x_n)
$$

where $p(X_1 = x_1, \cdots, X_n = x_n)$ are the [joint probabilities](https://statproofbook.github.io/D/prob-joint) of $X_1 = x_1, \cdots, X_n = x_n$ and $p(X_i=x_i)$ are the [marginal probabilities](https://statproofbook.github.io/D/prob-marg) of $A_i: X_i=x_i$.

# Independence of Random Variables

Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent <==> the elements of the [*Ï€*-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_system) generated by them are independent; that is:
$$
\textrm{P}(X\le x, Y\le y) = \textrm{P}(X\le x)\textrm{P}(Y\le y)
$$

# Conditional Independence

As noted at the beginning of our discussion, independence of events or random variables <u>depends on the underlying probability measure.</u> 

Thus, suppose that $B$ is an event with positive probability. A collection of events or a collection of random variables is *conditionally independent* given $B$ if the collection is independent relative to the conditional probability measure $A \rightarrow p(A|B)$. 

For example, a collection of events $p(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i)$ is conditionally independent given $B$ if for every $i$:
$$
p(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i | B) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(A_i | B)
$$
Note:
$$
p(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i | B) = p(X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_n = x_n|Y = y), \\
\prod_{i=1}^{n} p(A_i | B) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(X_i = x_i|Y = y), \quad \text{for all} \; x_i \in \mathcal{X}_i \quad \text{and all} \; y \in \mathcal{Y}
$$


where $X_1,X_2, \cdots,X_n$ are discrete random variables with possible values $\mathcal{X}_1,\mathcal{X}_2, \cdots,\mathcal{X}_n$; $Y$ is  discrete random variable with possible values $\mathcal Y$.
$$
p(X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_n = x_n|Y = y) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(X_i = x_i|Y = y) \quad
$$
