# Citation&Reference

[citation-styles](https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/citation-styles/)



I use [apa style citation(7th)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/edited-book-chapter-references).

## APA

I wrote a python script to generate it aumatically. [Code](https://github.com/LYK-love/APA-Toolkit)

> APA style citations are added in the body of a research paper or project and references are added to the last page.
>
> **Citations**, which are called in-text citations, are included when you’re adding information from another individual’s work into your own project. When you add text word-for-word from another source into your project, or take information from another source and place it in your own words and writing style (known as paraphrasing), you create an in-text citation. These citations are short in length and are placed in the main part of your project, directly after the borrowed information.
>
> **References** are found at the end of your [research](https://www.citationmachine.net/grammar-and-plagiarism/research-paper/) project, usually on the last page. Included on this reference list page is the full information for any in-text citations found in the body of the project. These references are listed in alphabetical order by the author's last name.
>
> An APA in-text citation includes only three items: the last name(s) of the author(s), the year the source was published, and sometimes the page or location of the information. References include more information such as the name of the author(s), the year the source was published, the full title of the source, and the URL or page range.

# Definitions

## For example

**For example** is a common phrase used to indicate an example or illustration to support a statement. In writing, it is often abbreviated as **e.g.** and used to introduce an example or series of examples.

This Latin abbreviation stands for “exempli gratia,” which translates to “for the sake of example.” The abbreviation should be written with lowercase letters, with a period after each letter, and followed by a [comma](https://www.scribbr.com/category/commas/).

> For example abbreviation in a sentence
>
> The use of informal language should be avoided in academic texts (**e.g.**, [theses](https://www.scribbr.com/category/dissertation/), [research papers](https://www.scribbr.com/category/research-paper/), and [essays](https://www.scribbr.com/category/academic-essay/)).
>
> I enjoy many outdoor activities, **e.g.**, hiking, camping, and fishing.
>
> During the [experiment](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/experimental-design/), participants weren’t allowed to use gadgets (**e.g.**, smartphones, laptops, or smartwatches).



> Note: **E.g.** is often used in [parentheses](https://www.scribbr.com/language-rules/parentheses/). In academic writing, we recommend using it only in parentheses and writing out “for example” in full in the main part of a sentence. Overuse of abbreviations, although it saves space, can make your sentences look messy.

### E.g. vs. i.e.

“E.g.” and “i.e.” are sometimes confused, but they have different meanings and shouldn’t be used interchangeably:

- **E.g.** stands for “exempli gratia,” meaning “for example,” and is used to provide specific examples that fall under a more general category.
- **I.e.** stands for “id est,” meaning “that is,” and is used to clarify or rephrase a statement to make it more precise or specific.

Example: E.g. vs. i.e.

The company provides a number of benefits (**e.g.**, yearly bonuses and generous sick pay) that make it an attractive place to work.
