Hi, I'm Yukuan Lu(陆昱宽). 

I am currently a first year Master student at the [ECE deaprtment of UCDavis](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Nanjing University(南京大学).

At UCDavis, I am doing research with [Prof.Yubei Chen](https://yubeichen.com/) on self-supervised learning.

# Misc

* I'm crazy about Zhuangzi(庄子) philosophy. I do believe that Science is a way to apporach 道, the external nature of the universie.

* I love Ancient Chinese Literature, such as 诗, 词, 赋.

  > 若夫气霁地表，云敛天末。洞庭始波，木叶微脱。菊散芳于山椒，雁流哀于江濑。升清质之悠悠，降澄辉之蔼蔼。列宿掩缛，长河韬映。柔祇雪凝，圆灵水镜。

  > --- 谢庄《月赋》

* Some favorite poets(诗, 词作者): 秦观, 姜夔, 晏几道, 吴文英, 李商隐...
