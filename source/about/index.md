# Yukuan Lu(陆昱宽). 

Hi, I'm Yukuan Lu(陆昱宽). 

I am currently a first year Master student at the [ECE deaprtment of UCDavis](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Nanjing University(南京大学).

At UCDavis, I am doing research with [Prof.Yubei Chen](https://yubeichen.com/) on self-supervised learning. I'm happy to talk about any research topics about machine learning.

NOTE: Recently I'm focusing on World Models, especially Hafner's DreamerV3. Basically the computer vision and reinforcement learning stuff. Feel free to talk with me!
