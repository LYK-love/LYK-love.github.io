* Base Station:  A base station is responsible for sending and receiving data (e.g., packets) to and from a wireless host that is associated with that base station.  **Cell towers** in cellular networks and **access points** in 802.11 wireless LANs are examples of base stations.

   the base station is connected to the larger network (e.g., the Internet, corporate or home network), thus functioning as a link-layer relay between the wireless host and the rest of the world with which the host communicates.
