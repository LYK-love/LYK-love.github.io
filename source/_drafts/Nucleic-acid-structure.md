# RNA

RNA主要以单链形式存在于生物体内.



* 按功能分, RNA可分为作为模板来规定蛋白质编码的mRNA和不用于蛋白质编码的non-coding RNA( ncRNA).

  > RNA molecule that encodes a protein is termed messenger RNA (mRNA). 

* mRNA: serves as a template for the protein's synthesis through translation.

* non-coding RNA: such as microRNA, transfer RNA.RNA (tRNA), small nucleolar RNA.RNA (snoRNA), small nuclear RNA.RNA (snRNA), or enzymatic RNA.RNA molecules called ribozymes[3] as well as larger non-coding RNAs such as ribosomal RNA.RNA (rRNA), and long non-coding RNA.RNA (lncRNA).

* RNA分子能够形成分子内的碱基配对, 进而折叠成特殊的结构



## Function

* Functions in protein synthesis
  * mRNA: as the intermediate between the gene and the protein- synthesizing machinery. 
  * tRNA: as an adaptor between the codons in the mRNA and amino acids. 
  * rRNA: play a structural role, as in the case of the RNA components of the ribosome.
* As genetic material: Serving as a template for its own replication in certain viruses.
* RNA as catalysts (ribozyme): Some RNAs (including one of the structural RNAs of the ribosome) are enzymes that catalyze essential reactions in the cell.
* RNA is a regulatory molecule: Small non mall non -coding RNA coding RNA which through sequence complementarily binds to, and interferes with the translation of certain mRNAs.

carries the information needed for protein synthesis.
