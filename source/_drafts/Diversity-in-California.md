# Labels

Sometimes, methods of categorizing people can help build understanding. For example, the label “survivor” can help people who have experienced sexual violence acknowledge their strengths and connect with community.

But labels come with risks, especially when they’re not self-chosen. In the worst cases, labels become a way of saying there is something wrong with a person or group. For example, “geek” can be either an affirming identity or an insult, depending on how it’s used and who is using it.

Labeling or categorizing can prevent us from seeing people as unique and complex, and lead to stereotyping. Stereotypes are widely held, but often incorrect, beliefs or generalizations about a specific group. They’re dangerous because they can prevent us from accurately perceiving things and can negatively impact the people being stereotyped.

# Power

Power imbalances exist in civilizations around the world, and this becomes an issue when access to power is inequitable. These imbalances can exist on an institutional level, as well. Because of this inequitable access to power, history has been told through the lens of those in charge, without allowing the stories of the disempowered to be recognized. 



Who tells the story?

Shaping a public or group narrative on an issue is a form of power.  It often takes place behind the scenes.  The steering committee decided on the messaging that influenced Scott to volunteer with the club in the first place... and by tabling for his club, Scott directly shapes the narrative by talking with other students one-on-one about their message.

Who is at the table?

Scott talks to several students whose families are affected by the industrial pollution.  They want to get involved, but can't join the club because they're working several jobs to make ends meet.  Scott realizes that his financial privilege has given him an opportunity to gain power and experience, because he has the time to volunteer.
