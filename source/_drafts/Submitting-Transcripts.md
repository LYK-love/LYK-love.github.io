# Submitting Final Transcripts

研究生学校会要求学生出具电子成绩单, 并且该成绩单不能通过学生个人的邮箱, 而是由学校的官方部门或者别的什么部门发送. 

以UCDavis为例, Davis强烈建议学生寄送电子的成绩单:

> **Send an Electronic Transcript (highly recommended):** If the institution issuing the transcript can send an official electronic version of your transcript to our team, please contact them immediately and have them send the document to [gradadmit@ucdavis.edu](mailto:gradadmit@ucdavis.edu) Note that the official document must be sent by either a secure, authenticated transcript delivery service (like Parchment, Credentials Inc., eScripps, etc.) or **by the issuing university's Registrar/Academic Affairs office. An electronic document sent directly from you will not meet this requirement.**





# Transcript Requirements 

成绩单有如下[要求](https://gradstudies.ucdavis.edu/transcript-requirements-new-admits):

对于国际学生, 要求成绩单上具有官方的印章, 并且必须对中英双语各自提供版本.

> Official international transcripts or academic records are defined as original documents issued by the institution which bear **the actual signature of the registrar** and **the seal of the issuing institution**. In the case of non-U.S. institutions, do not send the original of an academic record that cannot be replaced. Instead, obtain a properly certified copy. True copies, facsimiles, or photocopies of academic records will be accepted only if the photocopies themselves have been personally signed by an academic official who has certified that they are exact copies of original documents. Each attested copy must also bear the seal and title of the authorizing official. Uncertified photocopies are not acceptable.
>
> Official records in their **original** language must be submitted with the authorized, complete and exact **English translations** issued by the university, a government agency, or a certified translation agency.
>
> We are working with international institutions to receive certified transcripts via email. We recommend you contact the registrar or academic affairs office at your institutions to confirm whether they can send all certified documents to UC Davis directly by email. Electronic transcripts should be sent by the issuing institution directly to [gradadmit@ucdavis.edu](mailto:gradadmit@ucdavis.edu).
