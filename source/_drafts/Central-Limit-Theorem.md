title: Central Limit Theorem

In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that, under appropriate conditions, the distribution of a normalized version of the sample mean converges to a standard normal distribution. This holds even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. There are several versions of the CLT, each applying in the context of different conditions.



An elementary form of the theorem states the following. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ denote a random sample of $n$ independent observations from a population with overall expected value (average) $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$, and let $\bar{X}_n$ denote the sample mean of that sample (which is itself a random variable). 

Then the limit as $n \rightarrow \infty$ of the distribution of $\frac{\bar{X}_n-\mu}{\sigma_{\bar{X}_n}}$, where $\sigma_{\bar{X}_n}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, is the **standard normal distribution**.
