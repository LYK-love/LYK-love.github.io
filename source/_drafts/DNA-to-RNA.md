All mimsy was mRNA. That colored message unit array
All mimsy was mRNA. And protein chain outgrabe’
— Narration from the film *Protein Synthesis: An Epic on the Cellular Level*

While teaching a high-school biology course recently, I found myself reflecting on a low-budget movie that had delighted me as a graduate student decades before. The quirky 13-minute film in question, [*Protein Synthesis: An Epic on the Cellular Level*,](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb90484996) was produced on the [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) campus in 1971, with colorfully clad students depicting the roles of mRNA, tRNA, ribosomes, amino acids and translation factors, all while dancing to the beat of a psychedelic improv band.

# DNA, RNA and protein synthesis

基因表达包括转录（transcription）和 翻译（translation）两个阶段.

# DNA



# DNA replication

Replication: Synthesis of two DNA strands using both parental DNA strand as a template. 

> Each time a cell divides, **each of its double strands of DNA splits into two single strands. Each of these single strands acts as a template for a new strand of complementary DNA.** As a result, each new cell has its own complete genome.

* Replication is controlled by the Watson-Crick pairing of the bases in the template strand with incoming deoxynucleoside triphosphates.
* Replication is directed by <u>DNA polymerase enzymes(DNA聚合酶)</u>.

1 DNA molecule -> 2 DNA molecules



Duplication of a DNA molecule 



## Mistakes in DNA replication

* DNA replication is not perfect. Errors occur in DNA replication, when the incorrect base is incorporated into the growing DNA strand. This leads to *mismatched* base pairs, or *mispairs*. 

* DNA polymerases have proofreading activity, and a [DNA repair](https://atdbio.com/nucleic-acids-book/Mutagenesis-and-DNA-repair#DNA-repair-mechanisms) enzymes have evolved to correct these mistakes. DNA聚合酶具有校对活性，而DNA修复酶已经进化到可以纠正这些错误.

* Occasionally, mispairs survive and are incorporated into the genome in the next round of replication. These mutations may have no consequence, they may result in the death of the organism, they may result in a genetic disease or cancer; or they may give the organism a competitive advantage over its neighbours, which leads to evolution by natural selection.





* Transcription(转录)是指拷贝出一条与DNA链序列完全相同的RNA单链的过程，

# Transcription

**Transcription**: Synthesis of one RNA molecule using one of the two DNA strands as a template. 

* 拷贝出的RNA单链的碱基序列和DNA完全相同(除了T→U之外).
* The mRNA





是基因表达的核心步骤.

## Steps

转录的两步骤:

1. First, **pre-messenger RNA** is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes. 

   The process relies on Watson-Crick base pairing, and the resultant single strand of RNA is the reverse-complement of the original DNA sequence. 

2. The pre-messenger RNA is then "edited" to produce the desired mRNA molecule in a process called *RNA splicing*.



可以再细化为四步骤:

1. 模板识别 (Template Recognition) 
2. 转录起始 (Initiation) 
3. 转录的延伸 (Elongation) 
4. 转录的终止 (Termination)



## Terms

* **RNA polymerases**(RNA聚合酶): enzymes that <u>synthesize RNA using a DNA template</u> (formally described as DNA-dependent RNA polymerases).

* **Promoter** is a region of DNA where RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. 

* **Startpoint** (Startsite): refers to the position on DNA corresponding to the first base incorporated into RNA. 第一个被纳入RNA的碱基在DNA上对应的位置.

* **Terminator**: a sequence of DNA that causes RNA polymerase to terminate transcription. 导致RNA聚合酶终止转录的codon.

* **Transcription unit** : a sequence of DNA transcribed into a single RNA, starting at the promoter and ending at the terminator.

* **Upstream**: identifies sequences proceeding in the opposite direction from expression; f<u>or example, the bacterial promoter is upstream of the transcription unit, the initiation codon is upstream of the coding region.</u>

* **Downstream**: identifies sequences proceeding farther in the direction of expression; for example, the coding region is downstream of the initiation codon.

* **Primary transcript**: the original unmodified RNA product corresponding to a transcription unit.

## RNA polymerase

RNA聚合酶是转录过程中最关键的酶。 

1. 主要以双链DNA为模板，以4种核苷三磷酸作 为活性前体。 
2. 需要Mg2+/Mn2+为辅助因子。 
3. 它不需要任何引物.

## Difference between Transcription and Replication

转录和复制很像, 但有如下区别:

1. 转录生成是的RNA, 而不是DNA. (RNA是由核糖核苷酸组成的)
2. 转录由RNA聚合酶(polymerase ) 催化, 而翻译由DNA聚合酶催化.
3. The RNA product does not remain basepaired to the template DNA strand.
4. Transcription is less accurate (error rate: 10-4)

# Translation

Translation(翻译): 指以新生的mRNA为模板, 把Codon翻译成氨基酸序列并合成多肽链的过程，是基因表达的最终目的。

## Codon

**Codon**s: The amino acids that make up proteins are encoded by a nucleotide triplet codon: for example, the protein serine is encoded by the codons UCU, UCC, UCA, and UCG.

The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5′ end of the mRNA.

 The three “nonsense codons,” UAA, UAG, and UGA indicate that translation should be terminated.
