In probability theory, the expected value (also called expectation, expectancy, expectation operator, mathematical expectation, mean, expectation value, or first moment) is a generalization of the weighted average. Informally, the expected value is the arithmetic mean of the possible values a random variable can take, weighted by the probability of those outcomes. Since it is obtained through arithmetic, the expected value sometimes may not even be included in the sample data set; it is not the value you would "expect" to get in reality.

The expected value of a random variable $X$ is often denoted by $\mathrm{E}(X), \mathrm{E}[X]$, or $\mathrm{E} X$, with $\mathrm{E}$ also often stylized as $E$ or $\mathbb{E}$.



Depending on the context, the conditional expectation can be either a random variable or a function. The random variable is denoted $E(X \mid Y)$ analogously to conditional probability. The function form is denoted as $E(X \mid Y=y)$.
