Rust has:

- Memory safety without garbage collection or implicit resource counters.
- Some functional programming and object-oriented features, however it is neither OO nor FP language.
- Simple asynchronous programming.
- Pattern matching.
- Rich standard library, including collections, concurrent programming, I/O and platform abstractions.
- A growing list of community-developed libraries on https://crates.io/
